## About Hugo

A Static Site Generator built with Go

Notes:

- It's fast!!!
- Ships as a binary
  - homebrew (mac)
  - chocolatey (windows)

<div class="notes">
not going to cover eveything about hugo in this talk

static site generators are great for fast scalable content sites (not dynamic content)
Deployable to Github Pages and many other places

Since it ships as a binary, Go is not required to be installed.

If installing from github releases, be aware of the difference between hugo and hugo-extended.

homebrew version is extended by default
